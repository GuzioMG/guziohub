Hence I believe that Brave thought „Nah! We have Courier at home!”, like in the memes. Then I went „Wait, this looks even better than Courier!” and spent HOURS looking for what font did Brave use as a replacement, failed at that, but found an (even-even better looking) Hack, so I picked that instead.

First 5ms: voltage rises from 0V (represented as 0% opacity) to 325V (1% opacity) - sharply at first, then calms down (ease-out) near the end because of how Sine waves work. This is when the wave hits its peak, and this is also where the animation ends and starts going in reverse because of how „alternate” works. In the next 5ms it falls from 325V to 0V - softly at first, then accelerates and finally crosses 0V at high-speed (ease-in - but because the animation is reversed, that's what ease-out does here) and goes into the negatives. But we don't care about the negatives, so this is where our animation completes a single phase (it will now reverse again, into its normal direction). And we don't care about them because - even though the voltage would now go to -325V and then back to 0V (completing a whole phase of AC) to later rise to 325V, and keep cycling like that over and over again - from a CRT brightness perspective, 325V and -325V does the same thing, so our animation's complete phase can be half of what AC does.*/

Very subtle (at just 1%) because even that was enough to cause discomfort (I almost threw up lol) after a longer time, eg. an hour of being open in the preview window (unfortunately, on lower values (like 0.8% - which, even tho it's a minimal difference, it felt much less straining on the eyes) interference from the monitor's refresh rate started becoming an issue (the animation would work for a while, then get stuck (or rather appear as such), then continue again, periodically), so 1% is the lowest we can go, despite the discomfort). For the same reason (ie. this animation may cause discomfort, so there should be a way to stop it), we also have a listener for prefers-reduced-motion (since that's what ppl with epilepsy use, from what MDN told me - and last thing I'd want is someone dying because they opened my page) and prefers-reduced-transparency (opacity: is used under-the-hood to get this effect to work, so checking for that also seemed reasonable, even if I think? it's technically supposed to be used for other stuff). Ideally, there should be something like „prefers-reduced-flicker” (since neither reduced motion nor reduced transparency really fit - there's nothing actually moving in this animation, and transparency is an internal implementation detail for this effect, not something that a regular user would notice), but - allas - there is none, so checking if they have one and/or the other enabled is the only choice.*/

            <p class="termtxt-warnings support-warning-size-interpolation skipper_hider">[ *WARNING!* You seem to be using a browser that doesn't yet <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/interpolate-size#browser_compatibility" class="termtxt-links custom-link-underlining">support the 'interpolate-size' CSS property</a>. At the time of writing this, that feature wasn't available in Firefox or Safari (despite it being over a year since it entered a stable standard phase). You can still see the content, but the terminal-typing-like animation will look very broken (whole lines revealing at once; the cursors won't blink nor „despawn”). Consider using a real, Chromium-based browser (this is coming from a Firefox user, btw), updating Chrome (if you're using it already), or waiting until your browser of choice supports this feature (if that happens to be Firefox, you might want to consider <a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/donate/" class="termtxt-links custom-link-underlining">donating to Mozilla</a>, so they have more funds to implement web standards faster). ]</p>
