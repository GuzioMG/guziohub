        <h1>We don't spy on you</h1>
        <p>This Matrix homesever uses Tuwunel at the back-end. Whatever information Tuwunel gathers, will also naturally be gathered here. But I doubt it's much more (if anything at all) than what's needed for a homeserver to function (ie. your username, messages (and thair contents, if you're using unencrypted chats), profile picture, etc.), given that Tuwunel is an OSS project and those usually don't do any data gathering. Also, we if you're accessing GuzioHub Chat via https://chat.guziohub.ovh, then be warned that this runs on Element, which also may do some data gatheing on its own (it's also open-source, but feel much more corpoate-y than Tuwunel). Please consult the GitHubs of both projects (also, in case of Element specifically, you might want to check https://element.io/privacy and https://element.io/cookie-policy) to see how they process the data. We, as GuzioHub directly, aren't interested in your private information nor will we ever sell it to anyone.</p>
