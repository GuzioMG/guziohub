        <p>I don't give access to this homeserver to just anyone, so if you were allowed to have an account here, but something isn't working, you definietely already have a million other ways of contatcing me and asking for help. If you're some other homeserver owner, angry that my server is eg. pushing too much traffic to yours, you may reach me using some means listed in this server's .well-known file (preferably using Matrix, or via Email if there's something too wrong with my server) or via Discord (@.guzio.), not via this page.</p>
