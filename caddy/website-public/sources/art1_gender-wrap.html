<!DOCTYPE ghtml-v1.0 "human-readable://G-HTML is a special flavour of HTML, used by GuzioHub's custom templating engine (hence the „G”). It has no formal DOCTYPE, due to its tiny target audience, and in place where a link to the DOCTYPE should be (aka in the !DOCTYPE declaration), it instead has this very description text (which is, conveniently, a valid string that can be placed inside the !DOCTYPE declaration, thanks to its URI-style prefix - so various tools won't complain). This text is intended to be understood by models, like Copilot, to help them make better suggestions tailored to this HTML-flavour's spec, which is as follows: 1 - There are no HEAD or BODY tags, everything inside the HTML tag below, is already the body by default and explicit HEAD or BODY declarations are not allowed; 2 - The HTML tag must have these exact attributes, in this exact order: flavor (always „ghtml”), lang (like in vanilla HTML), canonical (a URL that will be placed inside a canonical-rel LINK-tag's href in the generated doc's HEAD), title (its content will be placed inside a TITLE-tag in the generated doc's HEAD), header (the header of the article, that will be injected into the body) and description (a human-readable string that will be placed inside a description-named META-tag's content in the generated doc's HEAD); 3 - the 1st line MUST contain this very !DOCTYPE, the 2nd line MUST contain an opening HTML tag with all the required attributes just specified, and the last line MUST contain a closing HTML tag, and nothing else is allowed on the 1st, 2nd and last lines (not an extra newline character, that certain editors (eg. GNU Nano) like to insert on the last line - this behavior will need to be disabled to effectively edit G-HTML files); 4 - Environment variables can be referenced anywhere in the content, using the %VAR_NAME% syntax, and they will be replaced with their values during generation; 5 - Lines SHOULD NOT be indented (although perfectly valid, doing this will lead to the indentation getting carried over to the final output (it is not stripped), which will look weird); 6 - All other standard HTML syntax rules (eg. no P-tags inside SPAN-tags, the ability to use escaped characters such as $nbsp;, etc.) apply as usual, while keeping in mind that every new contentful line in this file will become its own P-tag in the generated file (so this will affect what things can be placed inside, and how they will interface with each other, eg. you cannot really split an OL/UL across multiple lines because each LI would end up being placed in its own P, which of course isn't valid HTML).">

So... If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you either:
* Clicked the „Mateusz” name on the homepage
  and triggered a secret animation, then clicked
  the new name again, which was a secret link.
  In this case - congrats, you found an easter-egg!
  You are now contractually obliged to read this
  to the end, else you'll be missing crucial context.
* Are one of my friends, who got sent this from me
  as a link directly. In this case - know that
  you're officially honored as being among the MOST
  trusted people I know. As such, you are allowed to
  know one of my currently deepest-held secrets.
  The „prelude” to said secret would have been
  revealed to you, if you were to click "Mateusz" on
  homepage, but since you got here by a direct link,
  imma just tell you what happens, instead: It would
  <span>have changed to „Lena🏳️‍⚧️?” - and 10ms later,</span>
  turned into a link that redirects here.
...Or maybe both. You are my friend, who got linked here, but not directly. Rather, you were linked to the homepage and instructed to click the word „Mateusz”, wait for a moment, and click the link that appears. I like such little ceremonies/rituals like that.
At any rate - you're now here, and (if you happen to be a proud owner of a brain) you know already know what I'm about to say:
<span>I am... <span class="termtxt-warnings">NOT</span> trans? „huh;what?”</span>
...Maybe.
........Or maybe I am.
There... There is a reason why I put a „?” there.
I... I really don't know.

fuck...

<span class="termtxt-guzio-signature-yellow">Let's start with what's certain...</span>
I'm agender. That's... Basically??? sure,
by now.
I first got familiarized with this concept by a person who only goes by „The Poet” on a certain random Discord server. I noticed they had „agender” mentioned in their bio, got curious, and asked them.
This was during my own period of exploration (ie. by the time when I already came to the conclusion that I MIGHT be trans), so I was willing to accept that, whatever he* (*not sure; I vaguely remember that something changed in that department, but I wasn't on that Discord for a while, so idk) might say, will actually apply to me in some way. Especially because it already sounded like it could. „Agender”... „A”, as in none? So... No gender at all? Nope; zero; nada? Kinda like pan&nbsp;-&nbsp;but not related to sexuality? Now wait a hot-dang minute, that sounds really useful!
For some extra context about that „pan” thing: I always kinda understood pansexuality, and even to some extent related to that label, but at the same time, it seemed like utter nonsense (and also entirely unrelatable) to me. The part of me that related, basically thought: „Well... Gender, as a concept, is kinda pointless. It's basically a "macro" to someone's pronouns and what genitals they have (with a "trans, but not willing to have bottom surgery"-shaped caveat - which, btw, seems somewhat stupid, but that'll be discussed later in this article), or will eventually have (in case of pre-surgery (but otherwise willing to take it) trans ppl)", and all the extra stuff that we attach to it (like: how would someone dress, how are they supposed to behave and carry themselves, how much and what type of intelligence should we expect from them, or (God-forbid; that's the worst of them all) what hobbies they have and what should they like) are just toxic stereotypes that we attach to people unfairly, usually "just because others do it", or in active attempts to maliciosly control the population (eg. how Christians hate women - yes, I know, in modern times this is LESS of a problem (Salem Witch Trials are thankfully over), but don't pretend that it's not a thing that still happens). Any and all connections are made-up, and even the genital-pronoun connection is only an artifact of an earlier phase of language development (although some languages are still stuck in that phase - notably, Polish, where there is no genderless way to say many things). The only logical conclusion is that one shouldn't "see" gender at all, which is what pansexuals usually say about themselves. And also that I say about myself, hence it felt somewhat relatable.”. What I'm basically implying there is that everyone is pansexual, but some people don't know it because they're too stuck in some stupid gender wars on Twitter, in HR, and anywhere else, to notice that they're fighting a fight over something that doesn't even exist in any meaningful way. Well - that's where the „it [pansexuality] seemed like utter nonsense” stance comes in. Because if everyone is pan, then... Why is this even a category of queerness in the 1st place? What point could there possibly be in having a label that encompasses „any human”? Well - obviously - it's because it's panSEXUALITY! In other words, not only does being pan say „I can't see gender!”, but it automatically implies that you're also willing to fuck people with both types of genitals (remember: I just stated that my view of gender is „a "macro" to genitals+pronouns”, and because pronouns have no reason to change your preferences, then differences about sexuality must surely boil down to whether one prefers a dick or a hole - or both/none), which may not be the case for everyone. But... That'd be bi, right? And because bisexuals are already queers, then - surely - there is no way that they wouldn't be „enlightened” into knowing that gender isn't real. But that's what pansexuals are for! So then... Why do bi people exist, in this case??? It's always one or the other, man! One has to go. In a world where gender doesn't exist at all (outside of being a macro for 2 mostly unrelated things), there is absolutely no difference between a pan and a bisexual - and so only one should remain because it's impractical to have two labels for the same thing. ...Said „thing” being „will sleep with both a sausage and a "kitty"”. Which is also why I couldn't apply the pansexual label to myself, as decisively a sausage-disliker. Which would make me straight, then, I guess? But that loses some important bits of context. First of all, I don't entirely think that I'm „normal”-sexual (normal in this case would be the opposite of asexuality, aroaceism, and other stuff like that - but that's a topic for a different article). Second of all, I don't get a special badge that says „Hey, look! I'm one of the smart ones! I know that gender isn't real!” (even if this is entirely what I think), as pansexuals do. Third of all, I'm SPECIFICALLY a sausage-disliker. I couldn't care less about whatever the sausage is attached to. In other words: I wouldn't smash a transfem, if she were pre-op (I probably would be able to date one, just „No sex before surgery!” - tho I wouldn't date her, if she wasn't gonna get one at all). It gets more difficult with transmascs, but if we ignore all of that „I don't entirely think that I'm "normal"-sexual”-stuff - then yea, I absolutely would fuck a pre-op trans guy! Hell, I even know which one! One of my (transmasc) IRL friends is HOT AF - tho I'm sure there are more examples. The problem is that this isn't what „straight” seems to mean anymore! Quite the opposite: if you want to be seen as a „good ally”, then you're expected to only look at the preferred gender, not the pants, when picking people who align with your heterosexuality (or your homosexuality - but then we're not talking about being a „good ally” anymore, rather „good representation”, due to the fact that homosexuals aren't queer allies, but simply queers directly). For these 3 reasons, I always hated being asked about my sexuality. I'd usually just dodge the question, begrudgingly say „straight” (and pray that no-one's really paying attention too much), or give the whole statement about being specifically a „sausage-hater”, while praying that I won't be called a bigot (which thankfully doesn't happen too often, and instead I get laughed at, as in: „bro's scared of dicks”).
But this article is about my gender, not my sexuality. And in terms of gender - well, there are some problems. Mainly, my entire „gender is just a macro” philosophy doesn't work IRL. As much as I always thought that „anything else we associate with gender - how would someone dress, how are they supposed to behave and carry themselves, how much and what type of intelligence should we expect from them, or (God-forbid; that's the worst of them all) what hobbies they have and what should like” are just stereotypes that were CREATED from thin air (Okay, maybe not „thin air”&nbsp;-&nbsp;they&nbsp;probably&nbsp;have&nbsp;SOME&nbsp;roots&nbsp;in&nbsp;tribal culture and stuff like that, but SURELY that has no place in the modern world?) and everyone for some reason (Okay, there is a reason - it's because they're drilled into us from they day we're born.) fell for it, like some kind of global psy-op. But the crushing reality is that they weren't created, they were EARNED. Stereotypes don't come from nowhere - and research seems to strongly show that there really IS some fundamental biological difference between the brain of a man and a woman. Of course, that doesn't mean that we should treat these stereotypes as The Gospel. People are many and varied. Just because ON AVERAGE men will do/prefer/say one thing and women will do/prefer/say a different thing - doesn't mean that EVERY man will do/prefer/say one thing and EVERY woman will do/prefer/say a different thing. Averages are just that: Averages. They take cases from both sides and try to find the middle-ground, but that doesn't mean that everyone sits in that middle-ground. I mean... Femboys exist, right? If every man were „meant” not to like skirts, then there would be no femboys. The same thing will apply to literally every value we associate with gender. Yes, there are some common trends - and yes, there will be outliers. The key thing to understand here, however, is that these „common trends” don't happen because we, the „blank slates”, were fed gendered propaganda from the very young age (from toy colors to hair length) and we keep being fed it for the rest of our lives (although that indubitably IS a factor) - but rather that there are some basic biological differences between how (on average) brains of the members of a given gender will work, compared to the opposite gender. Okay, but what are said „biological differences” in the brain? Well... I recently stumbled upon a study that concluded, that on CT scans men and women (we're talking about preferred gender here, by the way - they tested both cis and trans people, with the latter on various stages of HRT) had completely different areas of the brain active, even though they were thinking about the same thing and/or solving the same problem (oh, btw: enbies showed a mix of both types of activity patterns). Again: That was on a CT scan - a cold and unbiased machine. So we're talking about something that cannot be faked or skewed by anyone's internal bias - not just another „Oh, hey, we tested the spatial awareness of men and women and found out that the latter has worse!”, which could still be explained by social preconditioning (if you hear enough jokes about how you're supposed to be bad with directions - you may eventually internalize it). Anyway... Finding out about that study - broke me. My entire philosophy was crushed in an instant. „So it really seems like we're not a blank-slate, huh? There is some fundamental difference, after all.” (Side-note: I actually heard of similar study in the past, where they chopped of the dick of an infant (it was a result of some medical accident) and instead of trying to recover from that incident, they forced him to live as a girl - anyway, he apparently hated his girl-life VERY much and later (de?)transitioned into a man. That equally points at some fundamental brain-level differences (born with a man-brain = will always be a man), but I guess my brain pushed that out of my memory because it didn't fit my view of reality, and I only now remembered about it again. I also heard similar things mentioned in school (about some basic differences between girls and boys), but I always dismissed them as simple ramblings of a bigoted teacher (in fairness, she was a J.K. Rowling simp, so I'm not exactly wrong on the „bigoted” part) and/or oversimplifications done for the sake of fitting into a 3 short paragraphs of an English book.) Anyway...! But... If there really are some fundamental differences, then... WHY CAN'T I SEE THEM AT ALL?
That's right, we're finally back on track! So... I cannot see gender differences. At all. From a very young age (we're talking, like... Kindergarten to early primary school, so about 3-12), they always seemed pointless. Like... As a kid, I was basically into any kind of toys/shows/plays, regardless of what gender they were „meant” for. An RC car or a helicopter? Fuck yea! They're so cool (tho I had a habit of crashing the chopper). My Little Pony? I used to GOBBLE ts up! Would always watch it in the evening; had a complete cast of mini-figurines. I didn't really possess any other girl-targeted toys (dolls, etc.), if I recall correctly, but I generally enjoyed playing with them whenever I was playing with other girls from my class. Which - yea, speaking of that: I had mosty mix-gendered friendships in that period. Not like „I always got along with girls better”, as some transfems will say; it's more like „I got along with both quite well as a young kid”. Which was quite odd, as the norm at that time was usually girls vs boys. Like... Classrooms would be physically split across an invisible gender divider (not by the teachers, or anything, just by people organically clustering with the same gender), and there would usually not be too much interaction across that „iron curtain” (Btw, that „iron curtain”'s existence also made no sense to me as a kid. I was completely unable to understand why we would be doing that, but I still „went along with the flow” without questioning it. Actually, THIS is probably the key takeaway from this „as a kid...” section. Not that I preferred some toys, or with whom I was friends with. I mean... That CAN and DOES happen, probably somewhat often. I don't think this implies any sort of un-cis-ness on its own. Rather, it's the fact that the division that seemed completely natural, logical, and essentially subconscious to everyone in my class - simultaneously made absolutely zero sense and felt entirely forced to my simple kid brain, that (after all) wasn't yet able to do any complex analysis of gender and everything, and was too going by what felt „natural”). Same on breaks (I think Americans say „recess” instead of „breaks”, but I shall keep using local terminology): small clusters of boys and girls (independently) would form, and usually there wouldn't be a lot of migration between those. Really, the only situation where there would be girls-boys interaction would be during PE, when (for the sake of convenience, I guess?) team games would be „the boy team” and „the girl team” competing against each other. And that interaction isn't exactly friendship-building, given how we're literally supposed to be rivals in a competition, not buddies. So - yea, my mix-gendered friendships were pretty unusual! (At least in my environment - maybe other schools were different, I don't know.) Tho unfortunately, most of them fell apart due to school transfers (Like... Literally, man! Every feminine friends circle that I was a part of during primary school, would always end after a year, because all the girls kept switching schools.), leaving me with a masculine friend circle for later parts of primary school (by which I mean 10-14 - yes, I know, there's an overlap; the line is kinda blurry). I mean... I managed to build some decent friendships with new girls (that kept transferring in - yes, the switching was bi-directional, apparently), but you can't exactly compete with friends who were there from the start. Also, by this time, the „girls vs boys war” was basically over, as my classmates got more mature and more interested in dating and stuff (I'm not counting myself in that because, as established, I never comprehended that war in the first place). So these new mix-gendered friendships that I had were no longer unusual, and as such - the late primary school period isn't exactly worth dwelling on (at least not yet - it will be relevant later because it also featured some gender-related trauma). Neither are highschool, nor uni - because by that time, my opinion was no longer shaped by observing general trends at school (like the „iron curtain”), but rather by reading/seeing stuff online and/or by agreeing/arguing with my friends. Speaking of online: Another part of that me „not seeing gender” is how I look at masculinity/femininity. And by that, I mean: I see - and possess - none. All those manosphere figures like Andrew Tate and the like never made any sense to me. I just couldn't relate to anyone who dwells so much on „masculinity” (talks about „domination”, „something-maxxxing”, etc., like they are, for whatever reason, men-only concepts) because I always thought it's made up. Like... I'd look at a clip of him saying something and just get... sad. My only thought would be „Nooooo! Why would he be driving the wedge between men and women? Aren't we all the same?”. It felt like the stupid „girls vs boys war” rhetoric from primary school, but for some reason spoken by a grown-ass man. ...Or a woman! Yes, here's the fun part: It's not just the manosphere. I had the same thoughts - EXACT same, 1:1 - about feminists. Every bit of disappointment that I felt for Tate, I equally felt for any random feminist that'd pop up on my YouTube feed. They were both sides of the same stupid „masculinity/feminity”-driven debate, even though (as I used to think) neither concept actually exists, and both are merely tools for control. I mean... I felt less resentment towards feminists because their motives at least seemed more genuine. Whereas manosphere commentators were very obvious manipulators, trying to trick you into buying their courses, books, camps, and other GAY-AF! shit that's somehow supposed to make you more attractive to women, but is always a scam - feminists just seemed misguided. Someone who got stuck in the past, back when fighting for women's rights (specifically) was still needed, instead of looking at the present, where we should be fighting for ABSOLUTE unity between genders, not be wasting our time on some „silly social constructs” like „femininity” or „(toxic) masculinity”. (Yes, I know, achieving that „ABSOLUTE unity” would STILL include fixing some „women rights” issues that feminists advocate for (like pay gaps, rapes, etc.) but I'm talking about the underlying cause of this advocacy (advocating for the wrong thing („women rights”) rather than specifically „equality”), not specific policy proposals.) By the way, this extends beyond just the manosphere-feminist question and affects any kind of situation where a seemingly pointless gender divide is present. For example, I find women-only groups on Facebook (like the popular-in-Poland „Baby bez Taboo”) to be somewhat stupid. Both from a security standpoint (I mean... Literally any guy can make a fake-woman profile.) and „ideological” (again: WHY are we dividing ourselves again)? Or when figures like Dr K say something-something-„masculinity” I just kinda roll my eyes (because why would he be trying to make some piece of advice, that could work great for everyone, look like something for men only? Or make a universal problem seem like a men-only problem? I mean... Yea, know-your-audience and whatever - but it was always kinda disappointing to hear a trained psychiatrist propagate the lie about genders being different.) - even tho I like him, overall. By the way, this is basically the 3rd time in my life I'm ever saying this (and - actually - the 1st time I ever said this without „toning it down”, ie. said „feminists” directly (not „those crazy "blue-hair-with-pronouns"-type feminists on Xitter”, as I usually would) or contrasted them directly with manosphere figures, instead of trying to emphasize the difference between them.) because I generally don't want to come of as bigoted. Anyway! Speaking of stuff that's gonna come of as bigoted (ye, that whole previous sentence basically only exists because I needed a segue, lol): My lack of gender perception also extends to any kind of... Transitioned-into genders!? „*gasp!* Oh no, does it mean that I secretly hate some ~30% of my IRL friends?” No, of course not. Let me explain this. Reminder: My view on gender is (or at least used to be) that it's basically a macro to pronouns and pants. Under that framework, there is essentially no such thing as a „binary”. A better scale would be a „gender ternary”, if anything. With a male („he/his/him” and a member; optionally expandable to „they/their/them” (on top of baseline pronouns) and a Promise&lt;member&gt; - and yes, I did just use JS (for anyone who can't read it: a Promise is a special return type that basically says „this function is still running, but we returned from it earlier - once it properly finishes, however, its return value (that currently is just this very promise) will transform into something of whatever type is inside of &lt;&gt;, in a process known as "promise resolution"”) to denote gender, lol), female („she/her/her” and a vag; optionally expandable to „they/their/them” (on top of baseline pronouns) and a Promise&lt;vag&gt;) and „advanced options” (custom pronouns; anything you want in your pants, so both Promises and „direct returns” (JS analogies continue...) are allowed, and even some intersex shenanigans). Just to be clear, this is not how I „fundamentally” view gender (my fundamental view is that I don't see it at all); it's more like „If gender has to exist in our world, then I guess I'm content with this form of simplification of it.”, mainly because these are the 2 only płeć-related (*płeć is the Polish word for both sex and gender) bits of information that I could ever possibly need about a person (pronouns for, well, basic communications and the pants-content due to my sexuality, which (to remind you) is officially „anyone goes, just don't have a dick in your pants”), while everything else can just be learned through interaction. And yes, I understand that it may seem somewhat weird that I'd care about things related to sexuality in, like... EVERY context ever. After all, it might by impossible/unethical to romantically pursue some people for other reasons than just them being of an „incompatible” gender. They could be already married or otherwise taken, or the context itself could be inappropriate for dating (eg. at some workplaces), or you could even be of an „incompatible” gender to them. But all of that assumes that I want to know sexuality-related stuff purely for dating. The reality is that I want to know that, well... Simply because everyone else does! Like... If we assume that a typical straight/gay person, in this day and age, cares about „presented” gender, then - just by looking at the pronouns - they'll instantly know if, at the very least, they're compatible with that person. It's not much (as I already said, there are other factors that may render romantic pursuit impossible), but it is SOMETHING. And I'm, meanwhile, left in the dark completely. So basically, I'm just... Jealous of people with „simpler” sexualities, I guess. Arrghhh, I'm talking about sexuality again! Back on topic: This gender „ternary” mental framework (because that's all this is, btw: a mental framework - I KNOW that gender is „supposed to” be something else, I just cannot and will probably never feel it internally, so I developed an approximation that works well enough for what I need) kinda causes some problems for certain kinds of trans people. First or all, enbies (which - sidenote - I don't understand (even accounting for the „imaginary” part of gender) why are they considered trans, as to me the word „trans” directly implies a binary action, ie. transitioning from one state to another, whereas the whole point of being an enby is to explicitly NOT be a part of this binary „state machine” at all). There are a lot of problems with them. For starters, it's the fact that some of them will be incompatible with the Polish language. Those who only set „they/them” and/or "it" as pronouns, without any „classical” ones as fallback (tho, thankfully, all those who I know IRL - do, so I don't have any negativity towards them) for languages that weren't „updated” to support this „newer spec” yet (to say nothing about those who only set some xenopronouns that ONLY work with English and cannot even be translated to, let alone expressed in, any other language, even if its pronoun system should be compatible with English). There is, quite literally, zero support for this in the Polish language and it'll either sound completely artificial (in case of „them”), or you'd be straight-up making up verbs to convey basic things (in case of „it”). This, btw, is entirely unrelated to my perception of gender (or lack thereof) and how it affect enbies, I just thought that if I'm about to say something that's guaranteed to piss them off, I might as well rip the band-aid off and say everything I think about them. Speaking of things that'll piss them off: The really spicy bit is related to where I place them on the „gender ternary”. You'd expect them to be placed under „advanced options”, but, uhh... That depends! If they DO have „fallback pronouns”, and those fallback pronouns happen to align with their „genital-derived” gender (I mean... Technically „birth-assigned” could fit here, but I can imagine some weird edge cases (eg. medical error, various intersex situations), where birth-assigned wouldn't be the same as „genital-derived”), then they technically go in the „male/female” (depending on their pronouns and „stuff”) category, functionally rejecting their nonbinarity in the 1st place. That doesn't, in any way, make invalidate their nonbinarity in my eyes. After all, the only person who decides whether someone is non-binary or not - is that very person itself. Whatever stupid „gender ternary” mental shortcut I use, couldn't possibly change that, and I am not trying to. I'd basically just see them as a kind of „non-binary man/woman”. Which SOUNDS incredibly stupid and (as I already said earlier) will certainly piss some enbies off (most will valiantly reject any gender-genital association), but in fairness - I have seen some enbies do this form of dual-labelling, so at least I haven't just committed a hate crime against all them by saying this, only some, I guess. That's something! Anyway, this entire „conflict” stems from the fact that I'm trying to assign a non-binary person onto some sort of a binary (or, ternary in this case, ig) system, even though the very idea of being non-binary is that you're, well, NOT on a BINARY. Not that you don't see it at all - you do; you know that some sort of a spectrum IS there, you know that most people are gonna be close to one or the other side of it, hence a binary of sort is formed. But you just happen to be closer to the center, hence NOT on that binary. And this was, for the longest time, the source of some resentment I felt towards enbies. They fully acknowledge the binary, but willingly „escape” it. I couldn't see it at all. „Oh, great! So you escaped something that DOESN'T EXIST. Fkin... Congrats! What next, daringly breaking through the confines of a... spray-painted circle? wow, so brave indeed” is how I felt. In retrospect, I now understand that these feelings were unjustified. Just because I can't see the binary, doesn't mean it's the same (or „should be” the same) for everyone. So - just to be clear - I no longer feel any resentment towards enbies. (Okay, maybe some mild language-related annoyance - please, guys, have some fallback pronouns with broad compat, seriously pls.) Now... Whether they feel any resentment towards me, for all that „non-binary man/woman” thing, is a whole different story. Some will, I'm sure. If you're among that group; if you're an enby, and you are offended by how I classify you, then please do know that I mean no harm to you or your community. All that „ternary” stuff is but an oversimplified mental model, that serves me a very particular, practical purpose (of telling me what pronouns to use „at a glance” - and also whether I can date a person, ie. they „map to” „female” or a schlong-less case of „advanced options”), and I am in no way advocating for it to become a standard way of classifying people. Yes, this internal representation may „leak” into the outer word on occasion (for example, I may refer to a „non-binary man/woman” as just a „man/woman” (of course, only in conversations with people who don't know them, while they're not present) for the sake of simplicity, if I don't find the information that they're non-binary relevant to the context), but these are merely exceptions to a rule and are in no way meant to be taken as me dismissing someone's identity. Second of all (yes, all previous 5195 characters were just enby-related problems; there's an entire second part): trans people unwilling to go through surgery. This case is simple: No surgery - then you're an „advanced options”-type person in my eyes. Keep in mind that this distinction is once again purely practical (ONLY for dating in this case (more specifically, I would not smash a non-surgery transfem (and if she never wants to have one, then I wouldn't date her, either, since as part of that „I don't entirely think that I'm "normal"-sexual”-stuff, I wouldn't date a person if there was no hope for ever having sexual intimacy), and while I could, technically, smash a pre-op trans guy, this gets difficult when we consider that the „no dating without intimacy” goes both ways („no sex without being together”), and I'd avoid dating a transmasc if I knew he's gonna become unfuckable at some point (ie. he wants a surgery - which is not what this sentence (yes, sentence - we're technically still in a big „()”-block) is supposed to be about (it's explicity for anti-surgery trans ppl), but I may as well mention it for completeness sake), and while I have no problem with a trans guy who swear to never pull a phalloplasty, I'm not really counting this as a likely possibility, as I don't think HE would be ever comfortable with a person, who (without him having that surgery) will never quite mentally map him as just a man, but rather always as some kind of „advanced options” being, whatever that might be), as one of those „options” is the ability to pick your pronouns) and isn't meant to be used as any kind tool of discrimination or invalidation against anyone. Like... YES, technically, within that mental framework - they're not „a real *insert preferred gender*”. But they're also NOT just a member of their birth-assigned gender. It's not like what some transphobes will say, like „Ohhh, you'll NEVER be a real woman! It's the bones, chromosomes, or... fkin God, apparently.” - and then in practice they mean „You're a man!” and will continue to treat you like a man (I put this through a transfem lenses because haven't really seen anyone do this with transmascs, but you get the idea). No - in my case it'd be „by this very specific definition, you don't fit the criteria for neither a man nor a woman (but that doesn't mean that I won't treat you like one, if you want me to)”. Again: „by this very specific definition”. If we drop all the layers of mental gymnastics, then (in my eyes) you're... Still not a real [insert preferred gender]? „Huh? Wait, so am I a transphobe, after all?” Of course not! Well, guess what!? NOBODY IS A MEMBER OF ANY GENDER (preferred or not) to me! Even the manliest cis-het man on Earth, peak masculinity, would still be „I dunno... Just a person, I guess!” because I just cannot FEEL it. From anyone! Cis, trans, man, woman... It feels the same! The only difference, as far as I'm concerned, is date-ability and how I shall call a person, but both of these can be changed functionally on a whim (one with modern medicine, the other with a simple „Please use...”) and are in no way fundamental to a person. Meanwhile, the thing that's SUPPOSEDLY fundamental; the gender that comes from your brain... I've never seen it coming off of anyone at all, ever. And critically - I've never seen it on myself, as well. „Anyone” here includes me. I feel zero internal drive towards my supposed „masculinity” AT THIS TIME. I used to, during a certain period (of about 10-14yo), have some slight „masculine flashes” in my head triggered by certain things, but that might be related to some gender-related trauma during primary school (the one that I mentioned somewhere above). Meanwhile, at the time of writing this, I seem to be going through a „femininity” supernova (not just a simple flash). But on a long time scale, it really seems like it all balances out into me experiencing zero gender altogether. Like... If I one day woke up in a fully-female body, I'd probably be somewhat confused (not by my new gender, but by „HOW? is this even scientifically possible??? WTF!?”), but otherwise as content as ever (or, at least, as content as I was up until recently); no dysphoria or anything. I'd just carry on my day-to-day life as Lena from now on (tho explaining that to anyone would be difficult, so maybe I'd only explain this to my parents and then just fake being my own sister to everyone else instead?), like nothing happened. Like, say, there was no gender to begin with? No-gender? Oh, my dear.....
That's, like... The definition of agender! (Oh my God, I finally escaped that 21259chr-long Chungusoid of a paragraph, yaayyy!!!) I AM agender. That's a FACT. I'm unable to see gender, at all. Not just in the context of dating (like a pansexual would, as explained in the 1st long-boi paragraph), not just „Oh, she simply doesn't know what gender is! Thinks that gender and sex are the same thing, what an idiot!” (as explained in the 2nd paragraph (tho it seems like my formatter blended it with the 1st one and I can't be bothered to untangle this), I do have CONCEPTUAL awareness of gender (It's some fundamentally brain-driven (both „learned” (through stereotypes and societal indoctrination) and biologically tied to its function (usually along biological sex lines, but not always, as „outliers” (ie. trans people) exist), as seen by CT scans) experience that makes you behave/act/think/etc. in a certain way that's distinct from the people of different gender than yours, but (on average) similar to other people of your gender), but I just struggle to relate to any kind of gender experience that most people seem to have; any and all gender-sex relations formed, are just meaningless mental shortcuts (the whole „gender ternary” model or the „macro to pronouns+bottoms”, which really is a part of that model) or artifacts of the Polish language (only one word, „płeć”) and don't affect how I overall perceive gender) - no! It's something different. Something that runs much deeper; probably resides at the same low-level brain bits as gender itself. It's some complete and fundamental inability to spiritually comprehend any „genderations” (be it gendered dating preferences, places, objects, shows, activities, stereotypes, your own attachment to your gender, or anything else) even if I have a conceptual understanding of them, that leads me to seeing all of them as simply „pointlessly gendered” (as explained in the humongous 21259chr-long monster above - and also by other beliefs I hold (eg. on how all gendered bathrooms should be abolished COMPLETELY - no bs „bathroom choice” compromise or „bathroom bans” tyrany, that serve exactly nobody and manages to just perfectly annoy everyone - make them all unisex entirely and see how much easier it is) and I wanted to put there but the paragraph got so long in was breaking VSCode in numerous ways lol, so I couldn't), even if everyone tries to tell me how good segregation in this case actually is, and how „A man simply won't get it”, even though it seems like every man I know DOES get it, and I'm the ONLY one who's always confused! Well, would you look at that: Maybe that's because I'm no „man” and I'm instead actually agender! That, seriously, explains everything! I have never encountered a label - of any kind, not just queer - that seemed to describe me so well, yet so simply. (Ok, that's a lie. There was one more, once - and that's „integration nerd”.) Thank you so much, Poet, for explaining it to me. And thanks to Kanciarz (this character wasn't mentioned yet - but if he ever reads this, he'll know that I'm talking about him, and that's all that matters) for giving me those „Agender Thigh-highs” on GhostLand (a Minecraft SMP, for the uninitiated). You probably didn't realize how validating those were and just gave me a random item you didn't need, but it truly made my day.
Anyway... I'm agender, so... Now what? Well... It all kinda boils-down to what I do about it, right? Do I scream it from the rooftops; announce this to all my friends; proudly display it on my homepage? Do I just stay quiet and low-profile, as I always had, with literally any gender-related take? (Actually... Maybe I was always quiet about gender because I just couldn't ever understand it on a „spiritual” level, due to my agenderness - not because „I was scared of being controversial”, like I always thought?) I mean... Being agender isn't the same being eg. trans, where you by definition have to go public with it at some point (the, you know, actual TRANSition). It doesn't affect me in my day-to-day life: If we were to consult my own gender ternary, then... I still use „he/his/him” (just for convenience: I look mostly like a boy, still, so people will naturally use them - so even if I honest-to-God don't care what pronouns one uses on me, is there any reason to „artificially” point it out?) and happen to be in possession of a „cannon”. So, I guess that makes me an „agender man”? If so, I suppose I can just keep the „man” part public-facing, and leave the „agender” as an extra quirk of my being, for those who care enough to look here. Will I? idk. Truth be told, I really do not know! This is all very weird and also kinda scary. Also exciting. And also made extra-difficult by a certain elephant in the room:

<span class="termtxt-guzio-signature-yellow">I could also just be trans.</span>
Yep. That throws a spanner in the works! The specifics of this shall be addressed in a later update to this post because I spent 2 days on that 1st half and I'm FUCKING EXHAUSTED.
